# Typographic conventions

These are the typographic conventions used in this book.

Code appearing inline in text paragraphs looks like this:

This code is inlined: `(lambda () (format t "Hello World"))`.

This is a code block in a file.:

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
(defun hello-world ()
  (format t "Hello World"))
~~~~~~~~

The following characters represent various prompts:

A `*` represents a Lisp REPL(Read Eval Print Loop, the lisp interactive interpreter), `=>` marks the returned result: 

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
 * (format nil "Hello World")
 => "Hello World"
~~~~~~~~

`$` is a unix shell, # is a root shell, or code executed with `sudo`:

~~~~~~~~
 # apt-get install foo
 $ foo --bar baz
~~~~~~~~

`>` is a windows `cmd.exe` prompt:

~~~~~~~~
 > dir C:\
